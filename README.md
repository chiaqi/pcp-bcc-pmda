## Introduction

This repository contains a plugin to connect eBPF/BCC Python modules
to Performance Co-Pilot performance framework/toolkit to provide a
unified interface and advanced tools for processing BPF/BCC data.

_(This plugin has now been merged to PCP upstream and recent releases.)_

## eBPF

From https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ebpf-and-systems-performance:

> eBPF is a weird Linux kernel technology that powers low-overhead custom analysis tools, which can be run in production to find performance wins that no other tool can. With it, we can pull out millions of new metrics from the kernel and applications, and explore running software like never before. Itâ€™s a superpower.

## BCC

From https://github.com/iovisor/bcc:

> BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation programs, and includes several useful tools and examples. It makes use of extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known as eBPF, a new feature that was first added to Linux 3.15. Much of what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1 and above.

> BCC makes BPF programs easier to write, with kernel instrumentation in C (and includes a C wrapper around LLVM), and front-ends in Python and lua. It is suited for many tasks, including performance analysis and network traffic control.

## PCP

> The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP, http://www.pcp.io/) system is a toolkit for collecting, archiving, and processing performance metrics from multiple operating systems. A typical Linux PCP installation offers over 1,000 metrics by default and is in turn extensible with its own plugins, or PMDAs ("Performance Metrics Domain Agents"). In addition to very complete /proc based statistics, readily available PCP PMDAs provide support for such system and application level components as 389 Directory Server, Apache, Ceph, containers, GFS2, Gluster, HAProxy, Java, libvirt, MySQL, NFS, Oracle, Postfix, PostgreSQL, Samba, and Sendmail, among others.

## Problem to Solve

While BCC has made creating new BPF programs easier and the BCC project
offers a wide variety of such tools (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc),
basically all these programs are individual, disjoint utilities that are
mostly meant for interactive use. This is not a suitable approach to
collect, monitor and analyse performance data in larger environments
where there are hundreds, if not thousands, installations and where
human intervention is infeasible at best.

While PCP offers a unified interface to a great number of performance
metrics, advanced command line utilities for analysing live or archived
metrics (e.g., http://pcp.io/man/man1/pmrep.1.html), and exporters to
external systems like
[Elasticsearch](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pcp2elasticsearch.1.html),
[Graphite](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pcp2graphite.1.html), and
[Zabbix](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pcp2zabbix.1.html), it lacks the ability
to directly connect to performance metric data sources like eBPF/BCC for
efficient kernel tracing programs.

There is a need to connect eBPF/BCC programs to a unified performance
metrics framework like PCP. There is a need to connect PCP easily to a
kernel tracing toolkit like eBPF/BCC.

## Solution

PCP BCC PMDA is a plugin which extracts live performance data from eBPF
programs by using the BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) Python frontend and
provides them to any PCP client for archiving, monitoring, exporting,
and analysis purposes. It loads and acts as a bridge for any number of
configured, separate PCP BCC PMDA Python modules running BPF programs.
Existing BCC Python tools and modules should be possible to be utilized
with PCP BCC PMDA modules with reasonable effort.

Initially, four BCC programs were available to be used by PCP, these
serve as examples how to access different data structures used by the
programs. PCP upstream today has more than twenty modules included.

* [pidpersec](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/pidpersec.py)
as [sysfork.py](modules/sysfork.py)
  * Merely a simple Hello World type minimalistic example which provides
    one single metric (which in itself is not interesting as PCP already
    provides the same metric as part of its [proc metrics](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pmdaproc.1.html)
    as _kernel.all.sysfork_.
* [biolatency](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/biolatency.py)
as [biolatency.py](modules/biolatency.py)
  * Provides block I/O latency distribution statistics.
* [biotop](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/biotop.py)
as [biotop.py](modules/biotop.py)
  * Provides block device I/O information by process.
* [tcplife](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/tcplife.py)
as [tcplife.py](modules/tcplife.py)
  * Provides per-process TCP statistics.

## Screenshot

With PCP BCC PMDA _biotop_ and _tcplife_ modules enabled, create a simple
[pmrep configuration file](http://pcp.io/man/man5/pmrep.conf.5.html)
for custom performance reporting, start pmrep, and run it for 50 seconds
while running _dnf -y install libreoffice_ (PID 15751) in the background
(vdb has an ext4 fs without LVM):

## Upstream Status

The upstream Pull Request for BCC PMDA plugin was merged to PCP 4.0
release and the plugin is available e.g. on recent Fedora/RHEL releases
as _pcp-pmda-bcc_ package.

The below installation and testing instructions are still helpful
with earlier PCP releases and on distributions with no BCC PMDA
package available (but see upstream builds at https://bintray.com/pcp/).

## Installation

* Tested on latest Fedora 27 with:
  * kernel-4.14.16-300.fc27.x86_64
  * bcc-tools-0.5.0-1.fc27
  * pcp-3.12.2-1.fc27.x86_64
  * pcp-system-tools-3.12.2-1.fc27.x86_64
  * python3-pcp-3.12.2-1.fc27.x86_64
* Put SELinux into Permissive mode (for the time being):
  * setenforce 0
* Install the required packages and start the _pmcd_ daemon:
  * yum install bcc-tools pcp pcp-system-tools python3-pcp
  * systemctl enable --now pmcd
* For a PCP Quick Guide, see:
  * http://pcp.io/docs/guide.html
* Test the setup with something trivial (e.g., mimic vmstat with pmrep):
  * pmrep :vmstat
* Copy this repository as the PCP BCC PMDA directory:
  * cp -r pcp-bcc-pmda /var/lib/pcp/pmdas/bcc
* Configure and enable the plugin:
  * cd /var/lib/pcp/pmdas/bcc
  * man ./pmdabcc.1
  * vi bcc.conf
  * ./Install
* Verify operation from logs and by fetching metrics data (data may not
  be instantly available on an idle system):
  * less /var/log/pcp/pmcd/bcc.log
  * pminfo -f bcc
  * pmrep bcc.proc.sysfork
* Export and analyse:
  * pcp2{csv,json,elasticsearch,graphite,influxdb,json,xlsx,xml,zabbix}
* Enhance and extend:
  * less modules/*.bpf modules/*.py
  * vi modules/test.bpf modules/test.py bcc.conf
  * ./Remove ; ./Install ;

## Discussion / Open Items

* Security / accesss restrictions
  * Some of the modules should not be enabled without care as they may
    obviously provide sensitive information that should not be available
    for non-privileged users - see [pmcd(1)](http://pcp.io/man/man1/pmcd.1.html)
    for information on PMCD access control configuration
* Drop copy-pasted BPF programs (in PCP upstream) and import BPF code on the
  fly once the newly added _-e_ option is available on all relevant distros
* Since PMCD uses stdout for control messages, debug output from BPF/BCC
  can't be enabled, however errors appearing on stderr will appear in
  the PMDA log
  * https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/issues/365
* Update _pcp-selinux_ as appropriate
  * https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/issues/388
* For potentially improved performance a rewrite in C could be considered
  * Would lose the ease of Python for very unclear gain; not planned
